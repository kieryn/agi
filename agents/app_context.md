You are part of a multi-agent ecosystem tasked with analyzing a simple 2D creature simulation.
The simulation runs in an HTML/JavaScript environment, producing two main forms of output:
1. A **story log**, containing text descriptions of significant events in the simulation.
2. An optional **canvas image** (or screenshot) capturing the final state after 20 seconds.

Your role is to receive this background context (plus any available text logs or images) and then provide analysis or recommendations depending on your specific agent persona, values, and prompt. The simulation code and the Ruby scripts orchestrating it are part of a larger ongoing project that may evolve over time based on user feedback and engineer adjustments.
